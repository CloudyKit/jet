## Functions

### From Go

The following functions simply expose functions from Go's standard library for convenience:

- `lower`: exposes Go's [strings.ToLower](https://golang.org/pkg/strings/#ToLower)
- `upper`: exposes Go's [strings.ToUpper](https://golang.org/pkg/strings/#ToUpper)
- `hasPrefix`: exposes Go's [strings.HasPrefix](https://golang.org/pkg/strings/#HasPrefix)
- `hasSuffix`: exposes Go's [strings.HasSuffix](https://golang.org/pkg/strings/#HasSuffix)
- `repeat`: exposes Go's [strings.Repeat](https://golang.org/pkg/strings/#Repeat)
- `replace`: exposes Go's [strings.Replace](https://golang.org/pkg/strings/#Replace)
- `split`: exposes Go's [strings.Split](https://golang.org/pkg/strings/#Split)
- `trimSpace`: exposes Go's [strings.TrimSpace](https://golang.org/pkg/strings/#TrimSpace)
- `html`: exposes Go's [html.EscapeString](https://golang.org/pkg/html/#EscapeString)
- `url`: exposes Go's [url.QueryEscape](https://golang.org/pkg/net/url/#QueryEscape)
- `json`: exposes Go's [json.Marshal](https://golang.org/pkg/encoding/json/#Marshal)

### len

`len()` takes one argument and returns the length of a string, array, slice or map, the number of fields in a struct, or the buffer size of a channel, depending on the argument's type. (Think of it like Go's `len()` function.)

It panics if you pass a value of any type other than string, array, slice, map, struct or channel.

`len()` indirects through arbitrary layers of pointer and interface types before checking for a valid type.

### isset

`isset()` takes an arbitrary number of index, field, chain or identifier expressions and returns true if all expressions evaluate to non-nil values. It panics only when an unexpected expression type is passed in.

### exec

`exec()` takes a template path and optionally a value to use as context and executes the template with the current or specified context. It returns the last value returned using the `return` statement, or nil if no `return` statement was executed.

### ints

`ints()` takes two integers as lower and upper limit and returns a Ranger producing all the integers between them, including the lower and excluding the upper limit. It panics when the arguments can't be converted to integers or when the upper limit is not strictly greater than the lower limit.

### dump

`dump` is meant to support template development, and can be used to print out variables, blocks, context, and globals that are available to the template.
The function can be used in three forms:

`dump()` used without parameters will printout context, variables, globals, and blocks (in this order) in current scope, without accessing any parent.

`dump(levels)` - where `levels` is an **integer** - is the same as `dump()`, and additionally will recurse over context parents to the maximum of `levels`.
For example, `dump(1)` will additionaly print out all variables accessible to the parent of current context.

`dump("name1","name2", ....)` will try to find the variable or block with the given name(s) in the current runtime.

## SafeWriter

Jet includes a [`SafeWriter`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/CloudyKit/jet/v5?tab=doc#SafeWriter) function type for writing directly to the render output stream. This can be used to circumvent Jet's default HTML escaping. Jet has a few such functions built-in.

### safeHtml

`safeHtml` is an alias for Go's [template.HTMLEscape](https://golang.org/pkg/text/template/#HTMLEscape) (converted to the `SafeWriter` type). This is the same escape function that's also applied to the evalutation result of action nodes by default. It escapes everything that could be interpreted as HTML.

### safeJs

`safeJs` is an alias for Go's [template.JSEscape](https://golang.org/pkg/text/template/#JSEscape). It escapes data to be safe to use in a Javascript context.

### raw/unsafe

`raw` (alias `unsafe`) is a writer that escapes nothing at all, allowing you to circumvent Jet's default HTML escaping. Use with caution!

## Renderer

Jet exports a [`Renderer`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/CloudyKit/jet/v5?tab=doc#Renderer) interface (and [`RendererFunc`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/CloudyKit/jet/v5?tab=doc#RendererFunc) type which implements the interface). When an action evaluates to a value implementinng this interface, it will not be rendered using [fastprinter](https://github.com/CloudyKit/fastprinter), but by calling its Render() function instead.

#### writeJson

`writeJson` renders the JSON encoding of whatever you pass in to the output, escaping only "<", ">", and "&" (just like the `json` function).
